#background:About the company
#Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
#By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.
#Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

###############This is the first part of my analysis for this project. after unzipped the files and browsed each files, the dailyActivities_merged.csv and dailysleep.csv were firstly read and analyzed.
################The purpose is to get have a general idea about the trend of smart device usage,in that most of the variables are involved.

#brief: 1.the Linear model is not too much necessary here, but the calories is not so much positively related to daily activities, which means the effectiveness and 
#is so different. We cannot say the clients do not care about this. More accurate calorie burning tips may help people find more effective ways to exercise.
#2.comparing with other index, Sleep monitoring is not so important index ,but the accuracy become very important for the smart healthy device.
#3.
